# Friendly fire humor

## Gun Laws

This means instead of accusing republicans of killing people with their 'ignorance is bliss' approach to guns, you need to use humor to make your points in a way that doesnt antagonize them

In that case an example would mean finding a democrat killed by guns and then you could say 
- 'ok that guy deserved it, but in general i dont like guns'

And build a joke on top of that like 
- 'maybe we could have a legal one-person sacrifice once every year and the Garys of the world would be hunted & you all could get out all your gun aggression on that person'

And make it clear youre joking - that would get pro-gun people on your side even without committing to that kind of policy, and anyone who objects just looks stupid for not getting that its a joke. This makes it possible for them to confront the extreme negative possibilities of their own beliefs (that some innocent person who could be them someday gets murdered by a gun) in an honest way that doesnt make them hate you bc you did it in a funny way - it's partly the improv method of 'yes and' but in a way that makes your original point, mixed with their actual beliefs, taken to a comical extreme.

## Abortion

On stuff like abortion you can ask them for scientific proof like:
- 'we should make babies sign a contract or pass a test proving that theyre not going to torture their parents by being failures or asking for stuff all the time or prove that they came from the holy dimension instead of hell and that they arent possessed by the devil & arent the antichrist, or else they have to get in the dumpster'
- 'we should have a return policy on babies if you find out theyre the antichrist or the second coming of jesus which would be a lot'

If theyre religious you can do the friendly fire humor again:
- 'the only reason I didnt get an abortion was I didnt want Jesus looking in there to check me for virtuous behavior' that mixes their beliefs with some ridiculousness that makes your original point and doesnt make them feel bad

## Medical Care

- 'we should make a deal with doctors that they get to kill their most annoying patient once a year if they make a big contribution to science'
- 'if patients want medical care without the new disability of crippling debt, they should have to prove that theyre below a certain level of annoying'
- 'if patients want to keep complaining about bills & request unnecessary, they can pay for their doctors' therapy'
- 'patients can be their own doctors by shooting off the bacteria with their medical rifles'
- 'patients only get science if theyre willing to protect gun rights with their lives'
- 'people who get old & acquire an infestation of legal teams arent mentally strong enough to will their medical problems such as aging away'


## Basic Income


## Consensus

- using 'friendly fire' jokes to build consensus & inspire confrontation of ridiculous beliefs
- one way to get people on your side is being extra decent when they expect you to fight them
